# AI-Image-Generator-with-OpenAI-s-DALL-E-3-Model
This repository contains a Streamlit web application that leverages OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model to generate images based on user prompts. Users can input a prompt, select image size and quality, and choose between using a real OpenAI API or a mock API for testing purposes. The app demonstrates integration with OpenAI's image generation capabilities.
